    "## 1.1 Creating a JSON schema\n",
    "\n",
    "When you produced your machine-readable file in Lesson 1, you came up with your own approach to how to structure the header row and the data. You named the columns yourself, and decided on how many, and what data should be in them. You did so by reviewing the source data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are problems with that approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How will you maintain consistency between updates? \n",
    "- How will different people, working on similar data or consecutive updates, ensure consistency between themselves?\n",
    "- How will you know if the restructured file you've created is actually machine-readable?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a programmer wanted to build an application - say an app that helps people find the nearest bus-stop - and you change update structure from release to release, they will not be able to automate their program, and that may prevent them from building it at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the data lifecycle isn't simply heading into your data and restructuring it. First you need to define a `schema`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data lifecycle](images/data-lifecycle-en.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `schema` defines the structural metadata for your wrangling process. This is not the format your input data arrive in, but it is what you require it to look like when you're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard terms used are defined by [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/) and further refined for use in structuring CSV data in Frictionless Data's [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, you need to specify the columns which an input CSV or Excel-file will be restructured into. The new columns are defined by the fields in your schema. These target fields are likely to be those in your database, or in your analytical software. Until your input data conform to this structure, your data will not validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Minimum valid requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimum valid schema requires a `name` to identify the schema, and a single, minimally-valid `field` containing a `name` and `type`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"A simple name\",\n",
    "        \"fields\": [\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"name\": \"Field name, e.g. 'column_name'\",\n",
    "                \"type\": \"Valid data type, e.g. 'string', 'number'\"\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else is optional, unless specifically required by that field-type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A JSON schema looks similar to a Python dictionary, but be very careful with `,` line-endings. The last item in a list must NOT have a comma. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can think of a schema `field` as a `column` in a table, or a `field` in a database. Fields have a `type`, such as integer or text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fields` value is a list, or - in JSON terminology - an `array` of dictionary `objects`. Each field, unsurprisingly, has a `name`, `title` and `description`, of which only the `name` is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields also have a `type`. This describes the data expected and limits the actions which can be performed during the wrangling process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `string`: any text-based string.\n",
    "* `number`: any number-based value, including integers and floats.\n",
    "* `integer`: any integer-based value.\n",
    "* `boolean`: a boolean [`true`, `false`] value.\n",
    "* `object`: any valid JSON data.\n",
    "* `array`: any valid array-based data.\n",
    "* `date`: any date without a time. Must be in ISO8601 format, `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n",
    "* `datetime`: any date with a time. Must be in ISO8601 format, with UTC time specified (optionally) as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss Zz`.\n",
    "* `year`: any year, formatted as `YYYY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more [types and formats](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#types-and-formats) like `geojson`, `geopoints` and variations on dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, these data can be `constrained`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `required`: boolean, indicates whether this field is compulsory (but blank values in the input column are permitted and will be set to the `missing` default)\n",
    "* `unique`: boolean, if `true` then all values for that input column must be unique\n",
    "* `minimum`: `integer` / `number`, as appropriate defining min number of characters in a string, or the min values of numbers or integers\n",
    "* `maximum`: `integer` / `number`, as appropriate defining max number of characters in a string, or the max values of numbers or integers\n",
    "* `enum`: a list (or array) of unique terms permitted in this field\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"name\": \"A simple name\",\n",
    "        \"fields\": [\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"name\": \"Field name, e.g. 'column_name'\",\n",
    "                \"type\": \"Valid data type, e.g. 'string', 'number'\",\n",
    "                \"constraints\": {\n",
    "                    \"enum\": [\"cheddar\", \"gouda\", \"other\"]\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are other [constraints](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#constraints), such as `pattern`, `maxLength`, `minLength` you can use as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Other properties\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also special properties you can add to your schema that are not part of the `fields` definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `missingValues`: defines which terms in your data should be treated as missing values, e.g. `-`, `NaN`, `..`, etc. This must be presented as a list, with terms defined as strings, e.g. `[\"NaN\", \"..\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.5 Example schema\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's imagine we want our destination data to conform to the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    =========  ============  =============  ========  ================  =====================  =============  ========================\n",
    "      la_code        ba_ref  occupant_name  postcode  occupation_state  occupation_state_date  prop_ba_rates  occupation_state_reliefs\n",
    "    =========  ============  =============  ========  ================  =====================  =============  ========================\n",
    "    E06000044  177500080710  A company       PO5 2SE              True             2019-04-01          98530  [small_business, retail]\n",

    "\n",
    "Your `types` - at this stage - are only a guide. You will have no feedback, or error messages like you get when running Python code, if any of the data types in your field columns are wrong. There are a few ways to get that feedback so you can correct things, but we'll start with data validation in spreadsheet cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is adapted from a [Microsoft Office tutorial](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/apply-data-validation-to-cells-29fecbcc-d1b9-42c1-9d76-eff3ce5f7249). This approach will work in OpenOffice as well as Google Sheets, although the specific steps are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft has an example file you can [download](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/6/8/968A9140-2E13-4FDC-B62C-C1D98D2B0FE6/Data%20Validation%20Examples.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Specify validation for data types\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the cells in a specific column you wish to limit by type\n",
    "2. Select __Data > Data Tools > Data Validation__.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Excel data validation](images/excel-data-validation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. On the __Settings__ tab, under __Allow__, select one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Validation settings](images/excel-validation-settings.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "  - __Whole Number__: restrict the cell to accept only `integer` values.\n",
    "  - __Decimal__: restrict the cell to accept only `float` or `number` values.\n",
    "  - __List__: pick data from a drop-down list, and limited by values constrained by `enum`.\n",
    "  - __Date__: restrict the cell to accept only `date`.\n",
    "  - __Time__: restrict the cell to accept only `datetime`.\n",
    "  - __Text Length__: restrict the length of the text, equivalent to constraints `maxLength`.\n",
    "  - __Custom__: for custom formula.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Under __Data__, you can select a condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - between\n",
    "  - not between\n",
    "  - equal to\n",
    "  - not equal to\n",
    "  - greater than\n",
    "  - less than\n",
    "  - greater than or equal to\n",
    "  - less than or equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set the other required values, based on what you chose for __Allow__ and __Data__. For example, if you select between, then select the __Minimum:__ and __Maximum:__ values for the cell(s).\n",
    "6. Select the __Ignore blank__ checkbox if you want to ignore blank spaces (i.e. for missing data). Note, though, that Excel doesn't have any room for special characters you may be using as a marker for missing data (e.g. `..`) so these would be raised as errors.\n",
    "7. Select __OK__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now - only for new data - if a user tries to enter a value that is not valid, a pop-up appears with the message, \"This value doesn’t match the data validation restrictions for this cell.\" We'll run validation on your existing data shortly, but first a detour into `lists`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Lists are a special type\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can validate a `list` type, you need to specify valid terms. In Excel, this requires an [extra set of steps](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-drop-down-list-7693307a-59ef-400a-b769-c5402dce407b).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new worksheet in Excel, and there list the terms you want to set as valid values. You can quickly convert your list to a table by selecting any cell in the range, and pressing __Ctrl+T__ (this may differ from version to version in Excel, or entirely in Open Office or other spreadsheet applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![List terms](images/excel-list-terms.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Add your list data and format it as a Table (__Home tab > Styles > Format as Table__).\n",
    "3. You can name your table from the Table tools tab - this one could be named \"CityTable\".  This will help you keep track of multiple tables.\n",
    "4. In the validation process listed above, go to 3. and select __List__, then add a named range or table name for your list. \n",
    "5. Specify a source for your terms via __Data tab > Data Validation > Allow List > Source__. Then specify your list of terms as any of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![List source](images/excel-list-source.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You can select the list sheet and range directly (e.g. `=Sheet1!A4:A10`)\n",
    "  - Convert your list to a table with __Ctrl+T__, then from the __Table Design__ tab give your table a name, permitting you to reference the table name and column (e.g. `=CityTable[City]`)\n",
    "  - From the __Formulas__ tab select __Name Manager__, create a __New__ item with an appropriate name (e.g. `CityList`), and reference the cells (e.g. `=Sheet1!A4:A10`), which then lets you reference your list anywhere (e.g. `=CityList`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 Validate and get error messages for your existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've specified validation rules on your existing data you might be disappoined. Excel does not automatically notify you whether these cells contain invalid data. Here's a quick way to [highlight existing invalid cells](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/more-on-data-validation-f38dee73-9900-4ca6-9301-8a5f6e1f0c4c) by circling the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Circle invalid data](images/excel-circled-cell.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To apply the circles, select the cells you want to evaluate and go to __Data > Data Tools > Data Validation > Circle Invalid Data__.\n",

    "  ![List terms](images/excel-data-circle.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. If you correct an invalid entry, the circle disappears automatically.\n",
