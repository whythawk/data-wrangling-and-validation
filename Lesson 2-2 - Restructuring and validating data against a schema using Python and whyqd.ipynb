Where working manually in Excel means that it is often impossible to trace errors without redoing your work, code can be read.

    "for quality machine-readable data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia - the definitive source - [declares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation):\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Data validation__ is the process of ensuring data have undergone data cleansing to ensure they have data quality, that is, that they are both correct and useful. \n",
    "It uses routines, often called \"validation rules\", \"validation constraints\", or \"check routines\", that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that \n",
    "are input to the system. The rules may be implemented through the automated facilities of a data dictionary, or by the inclusion of explicit application program validation \n",
    "logic of the computer and its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read through that Wikipedia article, you'll see that there are a vast range of different types of validation checks, but there is no universal standard. If _I_ declare a dataset\n",
    "\"valid\" it may not be valid for _your_ requirements. \n",

    "own validation at each step to ensure your own software works.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a data publisher perspective, it's difficult to predict all the use-cases for your data, and anything you do to \"force\" data into compliance runs the risk of degrading the \n",
    "data accuracy. Consider the following problems in our source data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Data gaps__: a range of terms, such as `..` and `.`, are used to reflect a lack of data. But isn't that still information? These terms tells us directly that, in 2008, we __did not__\n",
    "  __know__ how many people were illiterate, or how many people didn't have access to clean, running water in some countries. Replacing this with `nan` (not-a-number) doesn't change that \n",
    "  lack of information, although it might allow your data to pass a \"is this column only numbers\" test ... is that good? Wouldn't some users like to know directly?\n",
    "- __Data approximations__: Sometimes data are collected as ranges, e.g. `20-30`, or `<2`. This may for data anonymisation (we deliberately bucket people into ranges to ensure that\n",
    "  individuals can't be identified), or because our data are simply not sufficiently accurate (limits of the mechanism by which we recorded the data). This, also, is information. Forcing\n",
    "  these ranges to an absolute point may satisfy a data check, but at the risk of losing information on the limits of the data gathering process.\n",
    "- __Date formats__: When is 10 April also 4 October? When you're trying to figure out whether you're working with American or global date formats, e.g. `10-4-1990` vs `4-10-1990`. Date ranges\n",
    "  can also be a problem. Should you force `2007-2008` to be a specific year?\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data validation is certainly critical _at the point of use_, but is it important _at the point of publication_? How far should you go in validating data for publication?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where different data scientists may differ. My view is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Data validation__ is the process of ensuring a complete audit trail from source data to publication, where the process for data transformation is documented in a series of metadata\n",
    "files that transcribe the technical steps which produced the data, and all the definitions required to understand the terms used, data types and structure, and any assumptions or \n",
