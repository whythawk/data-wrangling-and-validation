    "## 2.1 Methods for data anonymisation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide range of techniques available to support anonymisation. Broadly, though, they fit into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Redaction__: in which we remove fields or line-item information while maintaining sufficient integrity to permit semantic analysis;\n",
    "- __Aggregation__: in which we deliberately aggregate data to ensure outlier anonymity;\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Redaction methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start doing anything, we need to understand our dataset, and understand how we intend to redact it _while maintaining its internal integrity so that we can continue to conduct analysis_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute suppression\n",
    "\n",
    "This method requires that we delete an entire field. It is one of the first, and easiest, steps we can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove data we do not need\n",
    "- Remove data we cannot easily redact\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a destructive step since suppression deletes the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudonymisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudonymisation is the replacement of identifying data with randomised values. This can be reversable, if you create a key between the data and the generated values, but irreversable if you deliberately throw aways the keys. Persistent pseudonyms support linkage between the same individual across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalisation is a deliberate reduction in the precision of data, such as converting a person's age into a range, or a precise location into a less precise location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `range`: conversion of precise numbers into quantiles or statistical ranges;\n",
    "- `cluster`: aggregation of geospatial data into statistically less significant clusters - this can also be used to mask outliers;\n",
    "\n",
    "Design the data ranges with appropriate sizes. Sometimes quantiles are the most appropriate, sometimes we use statistical definitions (such as geospatial ranges that are designed to include sufficient numbers of people so as to reduce deanonymisation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shuffling\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffling is where data are rearranged such that the individual attribute values are still represented in the dataset, but generally, do not correspond to the original records. This is not appropriate for all data. Swapping diseases amongst different patients will certainly render the data anonymous, but will also confuse any epidemiological analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Aggregation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation is far more destructive than is redaction. We will lose resolution on patient morphology, and we will lose the direct relationships between data in exchange for summaries of that data. But we will gain security for the individuals concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where redaction is guided by the data almost exclusively, aggregation is guided by the research objectives for the data. Any form of aggregation will limit what can be done and awareness of these limitations is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Census data are usually aggregated in this way, with the individual microdata (responses from each household) only made available to accredited researchers, while the aggregated versions are made available to the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective will be to create groups of data and then perform aggregations on each group. The range of aggregations we can form include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `count`: count of the individual members of the group;\n",
    "- `totals`: sums of values, and sums of sub-groups within the values (e.g. total duration of illness, and duration of each type of illness);\n",
    "- `averages`: including `mean`, `median` and `mode` of data sequences;\n",
    "- `distributions`: including `quantiles`, `normals` or other types of distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The groups can be by specific `categories` or `geospatial` ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, an entire course of statistics is required to perform aggregations well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <p><b>Aggregations require familiarity and experience with the data being aggregated.</b> It's very difficult to simply pick up a random dataset and know how to aggregate it\n",
    "        in a way that supports analysis and extracts meaning from it. You are unlikely to be responsible for aggregating data you don't have experience with, and when you have that\n",
    "        experience, knowing how to aggregate it will become clearer.</p>\n",

    "## 2.2 Apply data validation to cells in a spreadsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is adapted from a [Microsoft Office tutorial](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/apply-data-validation-to-cells-29fecbcc-d1b9-42c1-9d76-eff3ce5f7249). This approach will work in OpenOffice as well as Google Sheets, although the specific steps are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft has an example file you can [download](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/6/8/968A9140-2E13-4FDC-B62C-C1D98D2B0FE6/Data%20Validation%20Examples.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Specify validation for data types\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the cells in a specific column you wish to limit by type\n",
    "2. Select __Data > Data Tools > Data Validation__.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Excel data validation](images/excel-data-validation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. On the __Settings__ tab, under __Allow__, select one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Validation settings](images/excel-validation-settings.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "  - __Whole Number__: restrict the cell to accept only `integer` values.\n",
    "  - __Decimal__: restrict the cell to accept only `float` or `number` values.\n",
    "  - __List__: pick data from a drop-down list, and limited by values constrained by `enum`.\n",
    "  - __Date__: restrict the cell to accept only `date`.\n",
    "  - __Time__: restrict the cell to accept only `datetime`.\n",
    "  - __Text Length__: restrict the length of the text, equivalent to constraints `maxLength`.\n",
    "  - __Custom__: for custom formula.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Under __Data__, you can select a condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - between\n",
    "  - not between\n",
    "  - equal to\n",
    "  - not equal to\n",
    "  - greater than\n",
    "  - less than\n",
    "  - greater than or equal to\n",
    "  - less than or equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set the other required values, based on what you chose for __Allow__ and __Data__. For example, if you select between, then select the __Minimum:__ and __Maximum:__ values for the cell(s).\n",
    "6. Select the __Ignore blank__ checkbox if you want to ignore blank spaces (i.e. for missing data). Note, though, that Excel doesn't have any room for special characters you may be using as a marker for missing data (e.g. `..`) so these would be raised as errors.\n",
    "7. Select __OK__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now - only for new data - if a user tries to enter a value that is not valid, a pop-up appears with the message, \"This value doesnâ€™t match the data validation restrictions for this cell.\" We'll run validation on your existing data shortly, but first a detour into `lists`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Lists are a special type\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can validate a `list` type, you need to specify valid terms. In Excel, this requires an [extra set of steps](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-drop-down-list-7693307a-59ef-400a-b769-c5402dce407b).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new worksheet in Excel, and there list the terms you want to set as valid values. You can quickly convert your list to a table by selecting any cell in the range, and pressing __Ctrl+T__ (this may differ from version to version in Excel, or entirely in Open Office or other spreadsheet applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![List terms](images/excel-list-terms.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Add your list data and format it as a Table (__Home tab > Styles > Format as Table__).\n",
    "3. You can name your table from the Table tools tab - this one could be named \"CityTable\".  This will help you keep track of multiple tables.\n",
    "4. In the validation process listed above, go to 3. and select __List__, then add a named range or table name for your list. \n",
    "5. Specify a source for your terms via __Data tab > Data Validation > Allow List > Source__. Then specify your list of terms as any of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![List source](images/excel-list-source.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You can select the list sheet and range directly (e.g. `=Sheet1!A4:A10`)\n",
    "  - Convert your list to a table with __Ctrl+T__, then from the __Table Design__ tab give your table a name, permitting you to reference the table name and column (e.g. `=CityTable[City]`)\n",
    "  - From the __Formulas__ tab select __Name Manager__, create a __New__ item with an appropriate name (e.g. `CityList`), and reference the cells (e.g. `=Sheet1!A4:A10`), which then lets you reference your list anywhere (e.g. `=CityList`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3 Validate and get error messages for your existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've specified validation rules on your existing data you might be disappoined. Excel does not automatically notify you whether these cells contain invalid data. Here's a quick way to [highlight existing invalid cells](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/more-on-data-validation-f38dee73-9900-4ca6-9301-8a5f6e1f0c4c) by circling the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Circle invalid data](images/excel-circled-cell.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To apply the circles, select the cells you want to evaluate and go to __Data > Data Tools > Data Validation > Circle Invalid Data__.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![List terms](images/excel-data-circle.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. If you correct an invalid entry, the circle disappears automatically.\n",
    "3. To remove data validation for a cell, select it, and then go to __Data > Data Tools > Data Validation > Settings > Clear All__.\n",

    "        <li><b>Ranges instead of numbers</b>: if, e.g. your range is <code>200-210</code>, you could reset this value as <code>200</code>, or <code>210</code> or even the range average <code>205</code>. Whatever you decide, document your decision in your metadata file.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Date ranges</b>: the same goes for dates, although you should be careful ... the likelihood is that a value applies from the end of the date range, not the beginning or middle, so e.g. <code>2008-2009</code> is most likely to be <code>2009</code></li>\n",
