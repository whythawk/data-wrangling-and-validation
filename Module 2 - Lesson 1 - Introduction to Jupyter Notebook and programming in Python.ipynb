    "\n",
    "The following tutorial is adapted from [GitHub's 'Hello World' tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and their [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/). GitHub is a particular implementation of Git. It happens to be where these lessons are hosted, but you are welcome to use any other service, such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or even the venerable [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Version control systems track the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can review project history to find out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which changes were made?\n",
    "- Who made the changes?\n",
    "- When were the changes made?\n",
    "- Why were changes needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git itself runs from the command line (that is, in a terminal window, and outside of the more familiar graphical interface you use to interact with your computer's operating system). There are many commands to learn, but we'll only run through the most basic subset you need for now. Git has a [Basics Video Series](https://git-scm.com/video/get-going) you can follow to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _repository_, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called _commits_, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called _branches_. Because Git is a distributed version control system, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson, for example, exists in a public, open-source GitHub repository with Git version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com) is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, and code review. You can learn more about [GitHub's _flow_ here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Create a Tutorial Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "A _repository_ is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. You can call it anything you like, but you will need a repository for this lesson and subsequent tutorials, so you may as well use this as an opportunity to get started. Maybe call it `data-wrangling-course`.\n",

    "\n",
    "_Branching_ is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a branch off the `master` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of `master` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `master` branch\n",
    "- A new branch called `feature` (because we're doing 'feature work' on this branch)\n",
    "- The journey that `feature` takes before it's merged into `master`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Branching](images/github-branching.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `story.txt`\n",
    "- `story-joe-edit.txt`\n",
    "- `story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "At GitHub, developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to your new repository `data-wrangling-course`.\n",
    "- Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says __branch: master__.\n",
    "- Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the new branch text box.\n",
    "- Select the blue __Create branch__ box or hit _Enter_ on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![New branch](images/github-readme-edits.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have two branches, `master` and `readme-edits`. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make and commit changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you’re on the code view for your `readme-edits` branch, which is a copy of `master`. Let’s make some edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "On GitHub, saved changes are called _commits_. Each commit has an associated _commit message_, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make and commit changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click the `README.md` file.\n",
    "- Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.\n",
    "- In the editor, write a bit about yourself.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Open a Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have changes in a branch off of `master`, you can open a _pull request_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a _pull request_, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show _diffs_, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.\n",

Worse, any error is magnified, and any changes become tedious to manage.\n",
